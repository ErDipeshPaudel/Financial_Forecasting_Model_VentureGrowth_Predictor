    "# COMP2200/COMP6200 Assignment 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Due date: 11:55pm on Sunday April 6th 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note that daylight savings ends earlier on that day. Remember to move your clock backward by an hour.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "You are working as a data scientist in a venture capital investment firm. You have been given some\n",
    "data about a potential company to invest in. You will create some models to predict what the \n",
    "potential company will be like in 12 months' time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## About this assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "This assessment focuses on fundamental statistical analysis, which\n",
    "will apply linear and logistic regression techniques on one or more\n",
    "data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relevant ULO (Unit Learning Outcomes) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify the appropriate Data Science analysis for a problem and\n",
    "  apply that method to the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interpret Data Science analyses and summarise and identify the most\n",
    "  important aspects of a Data Science analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Present the results of their Data Science analyses both verbally and\n",
    "  in written form.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Total: 15 marks\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "Use https://classroom.github.com/a/BdRkY5OH to create a new empty\n",
    "repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete this notebook and add it to a new GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Submit this repository via Github Classroom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the video that you create (in the last step) to your GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't need to submit your CSV data file, but we won't penalise you\n",
    "if you do.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use of Generative AI\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to use Gen-AI tools (ChatGPT, Anthropic Claude, DeepSeek,\n",
    "Llama, etc.) to assist you in writing the code. That's what everyone\n",
    "in industry does nowadays. There are some suggested prompts at the bottom\n",
    "of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that you may be called on to explain what your code does and\n",
    "how it works, so if you have some code generated for you that you\n",
    "don't fully understand, spend some time with your Gen-AI tool asking\n",
    "for clarification until you are confident. Having a personal tutor\n",
    "guide you is one of the newest and fastest ways to learn to program in\n",
    "Python, so make the most of the opportunity. \n",
    "\n",
    "To help you remember what your code does, you can add comments to your\n",
    "code either by creating another markdown cell, or by using \"#\" at the\n",
    "beginning of a line in a code cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't use Gen-AI tools for writing reflections and observations. You\n",
    "will find many cells in this notebook where you need to enter markdown text.\n",
    "They appear like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your answer here. Replace the text in this markdown cell. Remember not to use Gen-AI here.**\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't want to use Gen-AI in these cells for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Thinking and reflecting is how you will get most of the benefit of doing this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It will produce meaningless and bland statements (that will be obviously meaningless and bland)\n",
    "  and you will get bad marks.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Marking Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "For a code cell, any working correct answer will earn full marks. For\n",
    "non-working code, or code that performs a different task, if it seems\n",
    "like you were on the right track, the marker may issue partial marks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For code cells that create visualisations, a correct answer is one that\n",
    "creates a meaningful and useful visualisation of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a text (markdown) cell, word counts are only a guide: this is how\n",
    "many words we think it will take to give a good answer. If you need to\n",
    "use more words, or can express your answer in less words, go ahead: a\n",
    "good answer will still receive full marks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answers given as dot points in a markdown cell are acceptable;\n",
    "likewise full sentences in paragraphs are acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "The textbook for the unit (_Introduction to Data Science_ by Igual and\n",
    "Segui) has some linear regression examples as well. You might find\n",
    "Section 6.2.3 useful if you are looking for sample code that performs\n",
    "linear regression. Section 6.3.1 has an example of logistic\n",
    "regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "You will find a large zip file called `2025-S1-COMP2200-6200-assignment1.zip` on iLearn.  When you expand it\n",
    "out, you will see many files, including one that begins with your\n",
